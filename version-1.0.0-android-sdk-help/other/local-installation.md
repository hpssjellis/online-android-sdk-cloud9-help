The workspace has a folder called advanced-local-install inside the start-here folder
the main files are called

1. 001-cloud9.conf	an apache2 site-available file set for port 8081 

1. load-local.sh	after the Docker installation this is the file to find and run to set Apache to port 8081 since the Docker install is using port 8080

1. on-your-computer.sh	A bash file to be copied to your Docker capable computer Note: these files take a lot of band width expect 7G per time you run this file. I use sudo nano on-your-computer.sh and right click paste the copied file.
