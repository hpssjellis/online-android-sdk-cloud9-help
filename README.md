What is really happening(longer version):

Use cloud 9 https://c9.io to install this repository then run setup.sh

bash setup.sh

(I just right click setup.sh and select run)

The bash file should:
1. install java dependencies
2. install android sdk 4.4
3. install gradle
4. create and App
5. ant or gradle build the app
6. auto update index.html with a link to the build .apk


Then load a webpage that gives your phone access to the app for testing (emulators suck!)

1. index.html right click and select run

1. menu preview - preview running application

1. set your Android 4.4 phone to the URL

1. set your phone security to unknown sources

1. install app





Note: unless you set a version number you may have to fully delete the App to be able to install the next version.
