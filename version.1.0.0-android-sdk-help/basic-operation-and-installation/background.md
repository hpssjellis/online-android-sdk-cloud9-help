 What is really happening here (The long version):
 
 Use cloud 9 https://c9.io to install this repository then run setup.sh
 
 bash setup.sh
 
 (I just right click setup.sh and select run)
 
 The bash file should:
 1. install java dependencies
 1. install the android sdk 
 1. install the platforms 4.4, 5.1 and 6.0
 1. install gradle
 1. setup paths for java, android and gradle
 1. make an ant example Hello World Android App
 1. make a gradle example Hello World Android App
 1. update the index.html with links to the .apk files
 1. start Apache2 web server. Note: The free version runs for about 24 hours then needs to be restarted. The paid version runs 24/7
 1. provide a link to open index.html in a new window
 


 
 
 
 
 Note: unless you set a version number you may have to fully delete the App to be able to install the next version.
